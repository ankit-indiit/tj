         <div class="inne-hed">
            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>The following sections describe the specifics of both types of groups from which data is collected: Customers and Testers.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="inne-hed">
            <h3>Testers</h3>
            <p>Testers should be aware that in taking part in User Tests, they may be disclosing information that could make them personally identifiable to UserTesting Customers. Testers should be aware that they are responsible for the content provided during their User Tests. UserTesting will not process Personal Data for purposes or by other means than as instructed by Customers or as otherwise necessary to provide the Services.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="inne-hed">
            <h3>Customers</h3>
            <p>In order to provide the Services to Customers, UserTesting collects certain types of data from its Customers. Further, Customers may collect or request information from Testers when utilizing the Services, subject to the terms of service entered into between UserTesting and all Customers.</p>

            <h3> Collection of Customer Data</h3>
            <p>During a Customerâ€™s utilization of the Platform and Services, Customers may be requested to provide information such as name, company name, email address, address, telephone or other relevant Personal Data (collectively â€œCustomer Dataâ€). This Personal Data is used by UserTesting to identify each Customer and provide them with Services, support, billing and to meet other contractual obligations. UserTesting will delete Customerâ€™s Personal Data upon request from such Customer, unless complying with such request would violate an applicable law, statute or other contractual obligation.</p>

For Tester Data, Customers have control of the purpose for collecting data. Customers with an active UserTesting account will therefore have the responsibility to delete data if required. When a Customerâ€™s account is terminated or expired, all Personal Data collected through the platform will be deleted upon written request from Customer as required by applicable law.</p>

         <h2 style="font-size: 20px;text-align: left">7. PRIVACY SHIELD</h2>
         <p>UserTesting complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. UserTesting has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/
            The Privacy Shield program applies to the processing of Personal Data in regards to the collection, use and retention of Personal Data from Testers located in Switzerland and the European Union and European Economic Area, as set out by the U.S. Department of Commerce. UserTesting has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, and recourse/enforcement/liability. UserTesting is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
            All employees of UserTesting who handle Personal Data from Switzerland and the European Union are required to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles.
            As part of our participation in the Privacy Shield program, we will resolve disputes you have with us in connection with our policies and practices through JAMS ADR. For more information and to contact JAMS ADR directly, visit www.jamsadr.com. As a last resort and in limited situations, Swiss and EU individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.
            UserTestingâ€™s accountability for Personal Data that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, UserTesting remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the Personal Data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless UserTesting proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
            UserTesting encourages you to contact our Head of Privacy and Security at privacy@usertesting.com should have any Privacy Shield-related (or general privacy-related) complaint. As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, a binding arbitration option will also be made available to you in order to address residual complaints not resolved by any other means. UserTesting is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
